HypTrails
=========

This repository includes an implementation of our HypTrails approach for comparing hypotheses about human trails.

The main functionality provided in this repository is the (trial) roiulette method. Other functionalities are part of the PathTools package that can be found at https://github.com/psinger/PathTools/.

Both packages can be installed by calling ```python setup.py install```.

Please check the ```unittests.py``` file for examples.

A thorough tutorial is provided in the folder ```tutorial``` in the form of an iPython notebook. You can run it yourself or take a look at the rendered output at: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/psinger/HypTrails/blob/master/tutorial/hyptrails_tutorial.ipynb
